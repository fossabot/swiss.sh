## purpose
i'm tired of hacking together libraries from all over the place. not only can
I benifit from the knowledge gained from the creation of these libraries, but
having a bunch of useful utilities in one neatly integrated self-contained
library is a major plus.

## documentation
for more information please consult the [wiki][4]. you will also find elaborated
descriptions of each tool.
