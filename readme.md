#[swiss.sh][1] ![build status.][2]
*a pocket sized library toolkit for any situation.*

## tools
* iterate
* list
* log
* propagate

## usage

## purpose
I'm tired of hacking together libraries from all over the place. Not only can
I benifit from the knowledge gained from the creation of these libraries, but
having a bunch of useful utilities in one neatly integrated self-contained
library is a major plus.
